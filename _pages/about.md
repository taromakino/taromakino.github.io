I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by Kyunghyun Cho and Krzysztof Geras. In 
my research, I apply ideas from causality to improve out-of-distribution generalization in machine learning. My aim is 
to develop simple and effective methods that are applicable to important real-world problems such as drug discovery.
